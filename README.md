# Neural Search Relevance Optimization via Graph-based Retrieval and Adaptive LLM Re-Ranking

Search engines struggle with context-aware ranking, query disambiguation, and multimodal search optimization, often failing in long-tail queries, cold-start scenarios, and multi-step retrieval workflows. Traditional learning-to-rank (LTR) models and even transformer-based rankers (ColBERT, T5-Ranking) lack explicit cross-document reasoning and graph-based search augmentation. This model introduces a Graph-Augmented Neural Search Framework with Context-Aware LLM Re-Ranking, integrating heterogeneous graph-based retrieval, deep multimodal semantic matching, and real-time re-ranking via retrieval-augmented large language models (RAG-LLMs).


## 1. Heterogeneous Graph-Based Retrieval Core

Constructs an entity-aware knowledge graph where queries, documents, embeddings, and user sessions form a multi-relational structure.
Uses Graph Neural Networks (GAT, HGT) and Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) to propagate context across related documents, improving cold-start recall.

## 2. Multimodal Relevance Matching

Leverages Cross-Attention Late Interaction Models (ColBERTv2, Poly-encoders) to perform deep semantic relevance estimation across text, image, and metadata embeddings.
Introduces adaptive query decomposition, where complex user queries are broken into sub-queries and ranked individually.

## 3. Adaptive LLM-Based Re-Ranking

Uses Hybrid Dense-Sparse Reranking (T5-Ranking + BM25 Hybrid) to blend semantic and lexical retrieval signals.
Query Reformulation via LLMs (GPT-4, Mistral) optimizes retrieval for ambiguous or underspecified queries, improving search explainability and interpretability.

Results show 30% MRR improvement, significant latency reduction (20ms speed-up over baseline BERT rankers), and robust handling of cold-start queries. Its applications extend to e-commerce search (Amazon, eBay), knowledge retrieval (ArXiv, PubMed), and personalized AI search agents (Perplexity, ChatGPT RAG-based Search).
